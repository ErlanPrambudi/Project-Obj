The dataset includes 292 images.
Shoes-OIqn are annotated in Scaled-YOLOv4 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 416x416 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Randomly crop between 0 and 15 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -12 and +12 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 2.5 pixels
